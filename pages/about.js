         students, faculty, and staff informed about everything happening on campus.
         From exam timetables to urgent fee deadlines and cultural events — it all
         lives here in one place.

         No more missing important deadlines or scrolling through WhatsApp groups.
         Every official notice is posted here the moment it is released.
